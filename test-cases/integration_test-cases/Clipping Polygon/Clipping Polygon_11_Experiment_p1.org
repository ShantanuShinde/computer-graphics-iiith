* Objective
  - To view the Experiment of the Clipping :Polygon experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-graphics-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Clipping Polygon/Clipping Polygon_01_Usability_smk.org][Clipping Polygon_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Experiment page  
  3. Enter the valid values of x and y axis of grid and click on enter button
  4. Enter the valid vertices values and click on start experiment button
  5. Click on the next iteration button and click on the previous iteration button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The next simulation page should be displayed on the screen
  4. The simulation process should start and the simulation result should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the next iteration button , next simulation page should be displayed obn the screen and the graph should also get changed according to the iteration values
  6. When we click on the Previous iteration button , previous simulation page should be displayed obn the screen and the graph should also get changed according to the iteration values
